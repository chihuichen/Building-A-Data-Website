# Overview
In this project, I'll build a website that shares a dataset.(usa-used-cars-dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doaaalsenani/usa-cers-dataset) \
I'll use the flask framework for the website, which will have the following features: \
(1) multiple plots on the homepage that gives an overview of the data, \
(2) a page within the website that displays the data in JSON format, \
(3) a link to a donation page that is optimized via A/B testing, and \
(4) a subscribe button that only accepts valid email address formats.
